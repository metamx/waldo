Where's Waldo? Maybe he's a dimension value in this structured log data set that I ingested into Druid. I can totally find dimension value Waldo using this project Waldo. Mind = blown. Waldo (this totally rad project) is a Node.js web-based search interface that queries Druid. What is Druid? Check out: www.druid.io
